		#LOC_ChemicalExotics_propellant_Diborane_description = Diborane is a cryogenic fuel which functions well as an exotic analogue to methane, yielding significantly higher specific impulse than pentaborane, and just as toxic.\n\nIn gaseous form it tends to spontaneously combust, so best keep it cold.
		#LOC_ChemicalExotics_propellant_LqdFluorine_description = Fluorine is oxygen's angry older brother, reacting with everything and corroding every surface it touches.\n\nPair liquid fluorine with almost any fuel for unbeatable performance and a good chance of national-scale incidents.
		#LOC_ChemicalExotics_propellant_N2F4_description = As oxygen is to dinitrogen tetroxide, so fluorine is to tetrafluorohydrazine, though the latter is not quite as reactive and even more expensive than the former.\n\nStill, this stuff is no joke, and if you treat it right you'll get the greatest hypergolic performance around.
		#LOC_ChemicalExotics_propellant_Pentaborane_description = Pentaborane offers very high performance and easy ignition with your favourite hypergolic oxidizers.\n\nWe're also told it's the most toxic substance we have the clearance for, something about not using it in atmosphere, don't worry about it.
